                        modelled AI behaviour as explicit, observable state

                        thesis remains relevant: modern AI systems drift
                        into opacity. Runtimes that make logic, data flow,
                        and side effects explicit help teams reason about
                        behaviour instead of guessing.

                                with no hidden SaaS layer that might change
