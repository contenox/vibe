# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Currently, only the latest `main` branch and the most recent `v*` release tag receive security updates.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is incredibly important to us. If you discover a vulnerability in Contenox (either the `vibe` CLI or the `runtime-api` server), please **do not** report it by creating a public GitHub Issue.

Instead, please email us directly to report security vulnerabilities:

- **Email:** hello@contenox.com

Please include the following in your report:
- A description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (links to a repository or gist with a PoC are highly appreciated).
- Any potential impact it may have.

We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 72 hours and strive to send you regular updates about our progress fixing it.

## Scope

This reporting policy covers the open-source code in the `contenox/runtime` and `contenox/vibe` modules, including the local execution sandboxes and HTTP server logic.
